        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A sublime taste into the world beneath the surface of the sunny cliffside coast, this dish is sure to conquer the fears of even the most seafood abstinent landlubbers. The three aquatic rapscallions are placed "on top of each other" and secured with an oversized fishing hook. Don't get too excited, or you're gonna get caught yourself! </p>
        <p>Looks are deceiving. Do not underestimate this dish. If you can't finish this dish, plop the remaining fish in your pocket to keep them warm and comfortable.</p>
