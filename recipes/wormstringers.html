        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Served with mud and dirt from outside," this dish contains earthy notes and a rich base of nitrogen and other key nutrients. Sourced from farm to table, worm stringers come straight from the place where all our ingredients originate from. They can also be found in your backyard or even the park! Enjoy nature in its purest form. Disregard the lies propagated by "How to Eat Fried Worms", written by Thomas Rockwell.</p>
        <p>Begin by admiring the unique form and composition of the dish. Experience each element with all 5 senses. Press your ears against the dish and listen to the cries of Mother Earth, then shove a fistful of the slimy stringers into your gaping mouth. If any bystanders question your tastes, threaten them by saying "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye."</p>
