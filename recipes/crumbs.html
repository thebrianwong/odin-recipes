        <h1>Floury crisper crumbs</h1>
        <img src="../images/crumbs.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A deep fried sensation like no other, this signature dish is made of an ambrosia that is worshipped by rock doves all around the world, a treasure that is highly valued by pigeons no matter how stale: breadcrumbs. To merely call this dish a work of art would be an insult not only to the chef who prepared it, but also to the entire culinary world. </p>
        <p>This work of art must be enjoyed several days after it has been prepared, preferably stored in a plastic bag so that all of the accumulated oil that has dripped down to the bottom can be marveled at for all of its glistening beauty, as if it were the golden sun kissing the grass and flowers of a verdant meadow.</p>
